#  Calculator

a simple calculator for the final project of Web Development 101! From The Odin Project's [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/)

##  Built With
  
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Reverse Polish Notation
 
## Note
I think that the best part of this project is to realize that you have to build a curious algorithm to interpret the user's input as a mathematical expression and then evaluate the expression to get the result. If you want to make a really simple calculator, maybe you don't need all this stuff, otherwise these links will help you to understand more about [Reverse Polish Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation) and the [Infix to Postfix Conversion](http://csis.pace.edu/~wolf/CS122/infix-postfix.htm).
